"At that moment,it seemed to him that time stood still,and the Soul of the World surged within him.When he looked into her dark eyes,and saw that her lips poised between a laugh and silence,he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke-the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in thier heart,it was Love.Something older than humanity,more ancient than the desert.Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well .She smiled, and that was certainly an omen-the omen he had been waiting for,for all his life.The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and his books,in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.

It was a pure Language of the World .It required no explaination,just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time.What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life,and that,with no need for words,she recognized the same thing.He was more certain of it than anything in the world.He had been told by his parents and grand-parents that he must fall in love and really know a person before being committed.But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language.Because,when you know that language,it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you,whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city.And when two such people encounter each other,and their eyes meet, the past and the future becomes unimportant.there is only that moment,and the incredible certainity that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only.It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world.Without such love,one's dreams would have no meaning."
